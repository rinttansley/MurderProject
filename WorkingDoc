---Notes---

~~ Order of operations for PGAdmin
Punctuation - quoates, parenteses, math operators
Numbers
Punctuation - ? and additional
Capital Letters
Punctuation - brackets, underscore
Lowercase letters
Punctuation - special characters, extended alphabet

~~ Operators
=
<> !=
>
<
>=
<=
BETWEEN
IS
LIKE - pattern (case sensitive)
ILIKE - pattern (not case sensitive)
NOT

**Probably want to create some statements utilizing at least the last 4/5 to show knowledge and ability to use

~~ Math Operators
+
-
*
/
% - Modulo (returns just the remainder)
^
|/ - Square Root
||/ - Cube Root
| - Factorial

~~ Good practice to avoid calling files .csv if the coma is not the separator/delimiter
