# MurderProject - This project is still currently in progress
### General Important notes: creating a GitHub is also its own work in progress
### While I do view myself as somewhat proficient in terms of navigating SQL, I fully believe there is still a wealth of opportunity for me to explore within SQL, particularly with Subqueries and answering interview style questions which will be an additional branch to this project repository.
### It is also important to note that while DBA is a topic I am passionate about and would love to explore more of, the roles I am currently pursuing are ones where I would hold more scope over retrieving data versus setting up the skeleton.


## Project Summary
This is a personal project I worked on to showcase my ability to use SQL. I chose a data set with information that I find interesting, utilized as many available commands as possible to answer analytical questions and visualized the results in Tableau. 

## Data Cleaning Methods
To create this project, I did not clean the data as I found it important to be able to assess what currently existed and be able to work with it directly in PostgreSQL.



## Programs Used
PostgreSQL - PGAdmin4


## Analysis Methods
Methods to be added in both SQL form and Tableau visualizations.
