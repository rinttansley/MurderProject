# MurderProject - This project is still currently in progress


## Project Summary
This is a personal project I worked on to showcase my ability to use SQL. I chose a data set with information that I find interesting, utilized as many available commands as possible to answer analytical questions and visualized the results in Tableau. 

## Data Cleaning Methods
To create this project, I did not clean the data as I found it important to be able to assess what currently existed and be able to work with it directly in PostgreSQL.



## Programs Used
PostgreSQL - PGAdmin4


## Analysis Methods
Methods to be added in both SQL form and Tableau visualizations.
