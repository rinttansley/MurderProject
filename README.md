# MurderProject


## Project Summary
This is a personal project I worked on to showcase my ability to use SQL. I chose a data set with information that I find interesting, utilized as many available commands to answer analytical questions and visualized the results in Tableau. 

## Data Cleaning Methods
This project required several things be changed in order to begin using the machine learning model:
* Updated column headers for clarity and ease
* Removed the timestamp column that Google automatically assigned as key values for each row
* Removed the UserID column as it was only relevant for the survey payment information



## Programs Used


## Modeling Techniques
Logistic Regression was used in this project as the data is all categorical. A combination of gbmImp, the marsModel and glm were utilized for feature selection. I additionally explored the Naieve Bayes method and a Decision Tree model but added the decision tree to my next steps of this project were I to take one.

## Analysis Methods
For the analysis, I utilized tabled confision matrix to show the number of accurately vs. inaccurately predicted categories. I also utilized a precision/recall graph for each model, I also utilized the precision, recall, f1 score and specificity to access all 3 versions of the model I showcased in my presentation.
